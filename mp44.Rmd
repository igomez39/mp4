#*DREAMWORKS*: Is the Dream Equal for All

![](https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/dreamworks-animation-logo.jpg?w=1000&h=563&crop=1)

### Question: Does the company "DREAMWORKS" use an equal number of men and women in their films and specifically in their top 5 films from 2010 to 2017?

#loading all the packages we need for this project
library(tidyverse)
library(ggthemes)
library(RColorBrewer)
library(mdsr)
library(RMySQL)
db <- dbConnect_scidb(dbname = "imdb")
```


```{r include=TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
#This is our final querry we used:
Dataset_Dreamworks <- db %>%
dbGetQuery("SELECT title, production_year, ci.note, ci.role_id, mi.info, COUNT(role_id)

  AND NOT INSTR(ci.note,'uncredited')
  GROUP BY title, role_id
  ORDER BY production_year DESC

```


```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, include=TRUE}
#Changed the column name of the column where we count the number of people.
Dataset_Dreamworks1 <- Dataset_Dreamworks %>%
  rename(count_cast = `COUNT(role_id)`)%>%

Dataset_Dreamworks1 %>%
  group_by(production_year) %>%
  mutate(genders = sum(Gender))

View(Dataset_Dreamworks1)

####Graph showing main actors and actresses in the company Dreamworks during years 1996-2017.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, include=TRUE}
#Used ggplot to plot number of actors and actresses per year.
gender_differences <- ggplot(data=Dataset_Dreamworks1, aes(y=count_cast, x=production_year)) +
  geom_point(aes(color=factor(Gender)))+
  labs(x= "Production Year", y= "Number of Actors/Actresses in Cast", title = "Gender Gap in Top Movies from Dreamwork Productions")

gender_differences + scale_colour_manual(values = c("blue", "red"))
```

####This graph shows the proportion of men and women in Dreawork's top 5 movies between 2010-2017.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, include=TRUE}

cast_count = c(5,9,2,7,0,1,5,0,1,4)
Dreamworks_5 = data.frame(title, cast_count, gender)
display.brewer.pal(12, "Paired")
```


```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, include=TRUE}
#Used ggplot to make a histogram of the total number or main actors and actresses in each of the top 5 movies and colored each bar with the proportion of men and women.
